# ML-Clustering
A project for hosting my learning and expertise in the specifics of data clustering in  field of ML. This is a personal endeavour to develop a better understanding of data clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The main purpose of this project is to consolidate my knowledge and practice of using K-Means algorithm to generate classes of classification for some given data. 

## Possible application
The project in its current form can be use to conduct initial data analysis for market segmentation and sorts of clustering business activities. The final executable uses a either a .csv or .json files for loading data. The csv data format is for loading raw data; while the json is for loading previously exported clustering models. 

## How to...
Grap a copy of the source code from this repositry and perform a local build using MS Visual Studio 2019. The resulting application is described in the rest of this portfolio item. The intent is to have the resultant application use as a utility in facilitating the acquisition of insights with the minimum of effort. 

## What next?
There are a few todo items on this project to enhance its usage. These enhancements include
1. the facility to cross validate generated clusters
2. further testing to ensure correct operation at all times
3. ui face lift
